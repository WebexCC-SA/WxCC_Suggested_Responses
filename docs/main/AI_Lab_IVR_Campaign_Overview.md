## Capabilities

An Interactive Voice Response (IVR) dialing mode enables a computer to communicate with humans using voice prompts and DTMF tones entered via a keypad. Typically, when the system initiates an outbound call to a contact, it provides options to route the call to the appropriate department or agent based on the selected input. However, for this lab, the call will not interact with an IVR system but will instead be directly connected to an AI agent.
