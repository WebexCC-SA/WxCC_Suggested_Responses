## Feature Description

Customers find it frustrating to repeat themselves, especially after a call drop. Now, agents can pick up where the call left off, reducing frustration and handling time, while empowering agents to work more efficiently.

The Cisco AI Assistant provides a summary of the recently dropped interaction, detailing the reason for the call and the last action discussed. This enables agents to seamlessly resume the conversation.

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:

Understand the provisioning process and Control Hub settings required to activate this AI feature. Review the agent configurations with the correct desktop layout. Test the feature.

## Build

2. Confirm that your Channel **<w class="attendee"></w>_2000_Channel** is still configured with the flow **AutonomousAI_Flow_2000_<w class="attendee"></w>** that includes the Autonomous AI agent, and the **Escalated** output is connected to the Queue node. This configuration is expected to remain the same as in the Autonomous AI Agent lab.
