Congratulations on completing the Cisco Webex AI Agent Digital Channel Integration lab! </br>


In this lab, youâ€™ve gained hands-on experience integrating your AI Agent with a digital channel using a Webex Connect flow. You successfully configured and tested the integration through a sample website, enabling a seamless customer experience.</br>


You explored how the AI Agent interacts with customers to suggest flowers, assist in designing custom bouquets, generate order details and pricing, and send order information to third-party systems. Additionally, you saw how the AI Agent facilitates email confirmations and ensures a smooth handoff to a live agent, complete with conversation details.</br> 


These skills empower you to design intelligent, end-to-end virtual agent solutions that enhance customer engagement across digital channels. Keep building and refining your expertise to create impactful conversational AI experiences!
