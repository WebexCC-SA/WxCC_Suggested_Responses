### Mission Details

Your mission is to configure intents, entities, and responses to check the status of an existing order that you created in the **Autonomous AI Agent** lab. In the next **Mission 4**, you will configure Fulfillment for this order tracking flow.

### Build

#### Task 1. Test the Order tracking flow. 

1. Click on the **Preview** button on the top right side to test the bot. Try the bot flow by typing ***"I want to track my order"***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="I want to track my order"><span class="copy"></span></span>. You will see that the Scripted AI agent is not yet configured to assist with this task.

1. While on the **Script** configuration page, switch to **Entities** tab and click on the **Create entity** option. Provide the name as ***order_number***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="order_number"><span class="copy"></span></span>. Entity type select as **Digits**.

2. While on the **Script** configuration page, switch to **Intents** tab and click on the **Create Intent** button located in the top right corner.
3. Add a new intent by providing the intent name as ***track_order***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="track_order"><span class="copy"></span></span> and include the following two utterances:

    - ***I want to track my order***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="I want to track my order"><span class="copy"></span></span>
    - ***What is my order status?***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="What is my order status?"><span class="copy"></span></span>

4. Click on the **Generate** button to utilize Generative AI for creating additional training phrases.

5. Enter a description such as ***Generate intents to track an order status***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Generate intents to track an order status"><span class="copy"></span></span> Set the Number of Variants to **10**, which will determine the number of new phrases to be generated.

7. You can review it later, but for your information, the **order_number** response was preconfigured for you for this lab. In this response, the AI agent simply asks for the order number. Refer to the picture below. This is an interim response needed to fill the entity.

Update variant 1 test to ***Please wait while I check the order status.***<span class="copy-static" title="Click to copy!" data-copy-text="Please wait while I check the order status."><span class="copy"></span></span>.
