### Suggested Responses Feature Overview

Suggested Responses is a real-time AI Assistant feature designed to support your contact center agents with contextual guidance, enabling them to deliver faster, more consistent, and positive customer experiences.


## Story

When a call is connected to a human agent, the Suggested Responses feature monitors the live transcripts and presents suggestions related to flower availability, pricing, and more, based on the uploaded documents containing all these details. This feature saves the agent time and effort by automatically searching through the documentation to provide the latest information to the agent and agent can review and provide it to the customer. <br>


Additionally, if a customer wants to track their order status, the Suggested Responses feature can place API calls to third-party applications to retrieve the order status and present it to the agent. This allows the agent to quickly access order information based on the provided order number without manually searching for it.
