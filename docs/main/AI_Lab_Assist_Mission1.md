## Feature Description

AI Agent Transfer Summary enhances agent efficiency and elevate customer experiences.

When a customer calls the contact center and interacts with an AI Agent, they may request to speak with a live human agent at some point during the conversation. Once connected to an agent, it is important for the agent to receive a concise summary of the customer's interaction with the AI Agent. This summary provides the agent with a quick overview of the customer's call reason. The "AI Agent Handoff Summary" feature provides this summary, displaying it on the agent's desktop within the AI-Assistant Widget.

## Mission Details

Your mission is to:

1. Configure a smooth handoff to live human agent from AI Agent.
2. Modify Virtual Agent transcript
3. Use AI Assistant
