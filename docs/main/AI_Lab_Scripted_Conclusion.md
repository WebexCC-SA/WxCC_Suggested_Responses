Congratulations on completing the Cisco Webex AI Scripted Agent lab! </br>


In this lab, you’ve learned to create and enhance virtual agents by integrating them with voice call flows, updating responses, adding intents and entities, and leveraging generative AI to improve training data. You’ve also explored using fulfillment to dynamically track order statuses. </br>


By following the call flow, you’ve seen how AI Agents can efficiently handle tasks like providing store hours and tracking orders, enabling seamless customer interactions. These skills equip you to build intelligent, effective virtual agents for real-world applications.
