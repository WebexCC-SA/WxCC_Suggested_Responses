Congratulations on completing the Webex Campaign for Contact Center lab!</br>


In this lab, you gained practical experience in configuring and managing outbound voice campaigns using the Webex Campaign module. You explored the Webex Campaign User Interface and learned how to configure essential components such as business days, contact modes, DNC lists, suppression rules, and telephony outcomes to ensure compliance and optimize campaign performance.</br>


You successfully created a Progressive IVR Campaign, where an AI Virtual Agent engages with customers to promote a flower show and facilitate order creation. Additionally, you learned to create campaign flows, set up outdial channels, configure new campaigns, and upload contact lists for efficient campaign execution.</br>


With these skills, you are now equipped to streamline and optimize outbound campaigns, ensuring compliance while achieving specific business objectives. Keep applying these capabilities to deliver impactful and compliant customer outreach solutions!
